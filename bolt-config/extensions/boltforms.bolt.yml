## File Uploads
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SECURITY WARNING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Handling file uploads is a very common attack vector used to compromise (hack)
# a server.
#
# BoltForms does a few things to help increase slightly the security of handling
# file uploads.
#
# Firstly, the directory that you specify for "base_directory" below should NOT
# be an route accessible to the outside world. We provide a special route should
# you wish to make the files browsable after upload.
#
# Secondly, is the "filename_handling" parameter. If an attacker knows the
# uploaded file name, this can make their job a bit easier. So we provide three
# options, e.g. uploading the file kitten.jpg:
#
# -------------------------------------
# | Setting | Resulting file name     |
# |-----------------------------------|
# | prefix  | kitten.Ze1d352rrI3p.jpg |
# | suffix  | kitten.jpg.Ze1d352rrI3p |
# | keep    | kitten.jpg              |
# -------------------------------------
#
# We recommend "suffix" as this is the most secure, alternatively "prefix" will
# aid in file browsing. However "keep" should always be used with caution!
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SECURITY WARNING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

uploads:
  enabled: false                                 # The global on/off switch for upload handling
  base_directory: /full/path/for/uploaded/files/ # Outside web root and writable by the web server's user
  filename_handling: suffix                      # Can be either "prefix", "suffix", or "keep"
  management_controller: false                   # Enable a controller to handle browsing and downloading of uploaded files

## Debugging
#
# Global debugging on/off switch
#
# If enabled, ALL forms will go into debug mode.  However, when disabled an individual
# form can still enable it's own debug â€” specific for and to that form
