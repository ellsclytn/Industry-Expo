prExpo
=========

This is the Industry Project Expo (prExpo) theme, based on the ["base-2014"](https://github.com/bolt/base-2014) theme for Bolt. It is built with Foundation 5 and Sass, but you can use it
as-is.

To install manually, go to `theme/` and do a checkout: 

  git clone https://github.com/ellsclytn/Industry-Expo.git

Set `theme: prExpo` in your `app/config/config.yml`, and you're good to go! 

If you wish to modify this theme using Sass, be sure to install the 'Foundation'
bower module, and start your favorite Sass parser, for example 'grunt':

```
bower install
npm install
grunt watch
```
